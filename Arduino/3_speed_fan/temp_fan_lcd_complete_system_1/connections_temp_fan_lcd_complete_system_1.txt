üîå Output Pins to DC Fan
L293 Output	Connect To
1 (Out1)	          Fan + (positive)
2 (Out2)	          Fan ‚Äì (negative)


üîã Motor Power Supply
L293 Pin	            Connect To
motor driver VCC	    "+" of External 9‚Äì12V power
GND	                  Common with Arduino + L293 + LCD + DHT22
‚ö†Ô∏è If your fan needs more than 5V, use external power for motor supply (separate from Arduino's 5V).
