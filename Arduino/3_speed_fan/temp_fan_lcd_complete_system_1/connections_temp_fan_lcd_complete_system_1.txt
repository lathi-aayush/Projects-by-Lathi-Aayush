✅ DHT22 Sensor Connections
DHT22 Pin	Arduino Pin	Notes
VCC	5V	Power supply
DATA	D2	Connected to digital pin 2
GND	GND	Ground

⚠️ Add a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between VCC and DATA (optional but recommended)

✅ LCD I2C (20x4) Connections
LCD Pin	Arduino Pin	Notes
VCC	5V	Power supply
GND	GND	Ground
SDA	A4	I2C Data
SCL	A5	I2C Clock

✅ L293 Motor Driver Connections (for one DC fan)
🔌 Input Pins
L293 Pin	Arduino Pin	Purpose
A1 (IN1)	D8	Fan direction control
A2 (IN2)	D9	Fan direction control
ENA	D10	PWM speed control
VCC	5V	Logic voltage (from Arduino)
GND	GND	Common ground

🔌 Output Pins to DC Fan
L293 Output	Connect To
1 (Out1)	Fan + (positive)
2 (Out2)	Fan – (negative)

🔋 Motor Power Supply
L293 Pin	Connect To
12V (motor VCC)**	External 9–12V power
GND	Common with Arduino

⚠️ If your fan needs more than 5V, use external power for motor supply (separate from Arduino's 5V).
