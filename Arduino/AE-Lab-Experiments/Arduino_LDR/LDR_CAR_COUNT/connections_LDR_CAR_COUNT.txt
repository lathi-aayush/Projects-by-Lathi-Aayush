LDR Circuit (Voltage Divider):
Component	Arduino Pin	Notes
One side of LDR			5V	Power input
Other side of LDR		A0	Analog input to measure light level
10kΩ resistor			Between A0 and GND	Forms a voltage divider

This creates a voltage divider:
5V -- LDR -- A0 -- 10kΩ resistor -- GND

LED Circuit:
Component	Arduino Pin	Notes
LED Anode (long leg)		Digital Pin 8 (D8)	Output from Arduino
LED Cathode (short leg)		Through 220Ω resistor to GND	Current limiting
