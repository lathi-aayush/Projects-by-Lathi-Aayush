ðŸ”Œ Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) Connections
HC-SR04 Pin			Arduino Pin	Description
VCC				5V Power supply
GND				GND Ground
TRIG				D3 Trigger pin (defined in code)
ECHO				D4 Echo pin (defined in code)


ðŸ”§ Servo Motor Connections
Servo Wire Color		Connect To Description
Red				5V Power supply
Brown/Black			GND Ground
Yellow/White			D5 PWM Signal (defined in code)
ðŸ›‘ Important: Servo motors can draw a lot of current. If your servo acts erratically, consider powering it from an external 5V source (like 4x AA batteries), and connect GND of battery and Arduino together.
